                <h2>My Design History</h2>
                <p>
                    Hello everyone! My name is Daniel Shim. I am living in South Korea. I am capable of speaking english
                    and korean. I have made this website to briefly describe and share about my design history.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since I was about 3-4 years old I started to play with toys called Playmobil. It was a toy that taught
                    me the things in our world. Like for example, cars, houses, buses, trains, planes, and buildings were
                    the things I learned through playmobil.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But since playmobil was just for very young kids I was bored with playmobil when I was at an age of
                    5. So my parents introduced me to a new world of Lego. Lego helped me learn the reality, increased my
                    creativity, and taught how the world works. In addition, I have developed my thoughts and designs.
                    But it also made memories with my brother. He and I made lego together. We had good memories together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After a while, my parents introduced me to a craft studio. I was able to design and build anything I
                    wanted. I was able to build house models, dolls, miniatures, and so many other craft designs. The studio
                    recycled materials for the kids to make projects. I used a lot of cardboard boxes, needles, fabric, and
                    etc. I was able to make my own creative world where my own thoughts and ideas were represented.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I entered 5th grade I was starting to develop a new sense of design ideas. I learned about
                    computer coding/programming. I was able to develop web designs where I can also show my thoughts and
                    ideas just like the craft studio. I really enjoyed learning about these new fascinating worlds. I was
                    also introduced to Minecraft which is a designing game for developing your own world. This helped me
                    get interested in housing, interior design, and architect too.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now I am still enjoying lego, Minecraft, coding, and crafting. Through designing I learned and
                    developed my own creativity and my own sense of looking at the world. Next time I would like to find
                    out new design ideas where I can share my thoughts and ideas creatively in my own way. Thank you! Bye!
